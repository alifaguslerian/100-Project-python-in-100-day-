# 🐾 Day 25 – Animal Sound Simulator

This project is a simple Python simulation that demonstrates the concept of **inheritance** and **polymorphism** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
Each animal class inherits from a base class `Animal` and overrides the `make_sound()` method to produce its own unique sound.

## 📘 Features
- Add different animals (Dog, Cat, Cow, Duck) to the simulator  
- Display all animal sounds using a single function call  
- Demonstrates core OOP principles in Python

Run With:
   ```bash
   python main.py
