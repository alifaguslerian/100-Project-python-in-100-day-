## ðŸ“– About the Project
This project is part of my **100 Days of Python Projects Challenge**.  
Itâ€™s an enhanced version of the previous dayâ€™s project (Day 16), designed to handle **CSV files with incorrect or missing headers**.  
The program corrects header names, calculates each studentâ€™s average score, determines pass/fail status, and writes results to a new CSV file.
