<h1 align="center">ðŸ’¼ Day 24 - Employee Management System</h1>

<p align="center">
  A Python program that demonstrates the concepts of <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b> â€” specifically <b>Inheritance</b> and <b>Polymorphism</b> â€” through a simple Employee Management System.
</p>

## ðŸ“– About the Project
This project is part of my **100 Days of Python Projects Challenge**.  
It simulates an employee management system where users can create and manage different types of employees â€” including regular employees, managers, and developers.  
Each employee type has its own bonus calculation method using polymorphism.

## ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Add new employees (Regular, Manager, or Developer)  
âœ… Display all employee details  
âœ… Demonstrates inheritance and method overriding  
âœ… Calculates employee bonuses dynamically  
âœ… Console-based menu system

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used
- **Classes and Objects**  
- **Inheritance** (Manager and Developer inherit from Employee)  
- **Polymorphism** (Overriding `calculate_bonus()` method)  
- **Encapsulation**
