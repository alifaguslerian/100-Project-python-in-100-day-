## 📖 About the Project
This project is part of my **100 Days of Python Projects Challenge**.  
It’s a console-based application that allows users to input a specific date and time for an event, and the program will display a **real-time countdown** until the event starts.  
Once the countdown reaches zero, it will display a message notifying that the event has started.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Displays remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds  
✅ Updates every second automatically  
✅ Handles invalid date/time formats gracefully  
✅ Prints a message when the countdown reaches zero
