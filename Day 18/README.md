## 📖 About the Project
This project is part of my **100 Days of Python Projects Challenge**.  
It allows users to **add, view, update, and delete tasks**, with all data stored in a `tasks.json` file.  
Even after the program is closed, all your tasks remain saved — thanks to JSON-based persistence.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Automatically creates a `tasks.json` file if it doesn’t exist  
✅ Add new tasks easily  
✅ View all tasks with their current status  
✅ Update task status (complete/incomplete)  
✅ Delete specific tasks  
✅ Persistent storage — tasks remain after program exit
